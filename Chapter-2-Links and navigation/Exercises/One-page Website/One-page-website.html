                    <h2 class="h-1">Plot</h2>
                    <p class="p-1">Breaking Bad follows the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. Struggling to provide for his family's future, Walter decides to use his chemistry knowledge to start cooking and selling methamphetamine with his former student Jesse Pinkman.</p>
                    <p class="p-2">As Walter and Jesse's drug operation becomes more successful, they become embroiled in the dangerous and violent world of drug trafficking, facing off against rival drug dealers, criminal organizations, and law enforcement agencies.</p>
                    <p class="p-2">Throughout the series, Walter's character undergoes a transformation from a mild-mannered, law-abiding citizen to a ruthless and calculating drug lord, as he becomes increasingly consumed by his desire for power and wealth.</p>
                    <p class="p-2">The show also explores the impact of Walter's criminal activities on his family and friends, particularly his wife Skyler, who is initially unaware of his illegal activities, and his brother-in-law Hank, who works for the DEA and becomes obsessed with catching the elusive drug kingpin known only as "Heisenberg".</p>
                    <p class="p-2">Ultimately, Breaking Bad is a character-driven drama that explores themes of morality, power, and the consequences of one's actions, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time.</p>

                    <p class="p-review">Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google "greatest tv shows of all-time" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed!

                    <p class="p-review"> One of the best shows if not THE best show ive seen. Im actually rewatching the show right now thats how much I loved it. The show has characters that look and feel so innocent yet through out the season you see them turn into a spawn of satan. It just how good they write the character development and the characters themselves. The story as well is just so different and entertaining. I have already recommended this to a lot of my friends I think you should too.</p>

                    <p class="p-review"> Yes, as many others have written before me, Breaking Bad is without a doubt one of the best series of all time.The story of how a desperate chemistry teacher ventures into the drug business with a former student of him is brilliant. Walter White and Jesse Pinkman face many ups and downs during their attempt of overtaking the Crystal-Meth-Market. In addition, the characters with Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are also perfectly cast. But the other actors play their parts very good aswell. A clear recommendation on my part. The series just doesn't get a 10/10 from me because I wouldn't call it one of my favorite shows.</p>
