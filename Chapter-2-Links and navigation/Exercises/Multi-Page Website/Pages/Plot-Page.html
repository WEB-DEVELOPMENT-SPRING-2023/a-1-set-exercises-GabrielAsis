                <p class="p-1">Breaking Bad follows the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. Struggling to provide for his family's future, Walter decides to use his chemistry knowledge to start cooking and selling methamphetamine with his former student Jesse Pinkman.</p>
                <p class="p-2">As Walter and Jesse's drug operation becomes more successful, they become embroiled in the dangerous and violent world of drug trafficking, facing off against rival drug dealers, criminal organizations, and law enforcement agencies.</p>
                <p class="p-2">Throughout the series, Walter's character undergoes a transformation from a mild-mannered, law-abiding citizen to a ruthless and calculating drug lord, as he becomes increasingly consumed by his desire for power and wealth.</p>
                <p class="p-2">The show also explores the impact of Walter's criminal activities on his family and friends, particularly his wife Skyler, who is initially unaware of his illegal activities, and his brother-in-law Hank, who works for the DEA and becomes obsessed with catching the elusive drug kingpin known only as "Heisenberg".</p>
                <p class="p-2">Ultimately, Breaking Bad is a character-driven drama that explores themes of morality, power, and the consequences of one's actions, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time.</p>
