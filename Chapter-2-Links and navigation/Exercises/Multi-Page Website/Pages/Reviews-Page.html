                <p class="p-review">Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google "greatest tv shows of all-time" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed!

                <p class="p-review"> One of the best shows if not THE best show ive seen. Im actually rewatching the show right now thats how much I loved it. The show has characters that look and feel so innocent yet through out the season you see them turn into a spawn of satan. It just how good they write the character development and the characters themselves. The story as well is just so different and entertaining. I have already recommended this to a lot of my friends I think you should too.</p>

                <p class="p-review"> Yes, as many others have written before me, Breaking Bad is without a doubt one of the best series of all time.The story of how a desperate chemistry teacher ventures into the drug business with a former student of him is brilliant. Walter White and Jesse Pinkman face many ups and downs during their attempt of overtaking the Crystal-Meth-Market. In addition, the characters with Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are also perfectly cast. But the other actors play their parts very good aswell. A clear recommendation on my part. The series just doesn't get a 10/10 from me because I wouldn't call it one of my favorite shows.</p>
